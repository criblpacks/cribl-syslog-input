        This conditioning pipeline is for use when receiving data over the
        syslog protocol, directly. (And, it's not for use when syslog-formatted
        data is being received from a Splunk forwarder, Elastic Beats agent,
        etc.)


        This pipeline reformats the logs by removing redundant fields; this has the net effect of removing some 30+ bytes for every event, without losing anything in the process.


        This pipeline also uses a lookup file to match hostnames/IPs to a possible sourcetype/index pair, a function that's equivalent to a Splunk forwarder's inputs.conf file monitoring syslog files on disk.


        Timestamp extraction and timezone normalization are also included. With certain syslog senders, a more-accurate timezone is included at the beginning of the message field.  A lookup file is also used to provide timezone information when none is present AND when the inbound time is off by one or more hours.

        Metadata notes: 


        In some cases, dedicated syslog ports are used for different device types; in such cases metadata such as index, source and sourcetype can be hard-coded to the Stream source using Processing Settings / Metadata.


        While this is the preferred approach, there are some devices for which the delivery port is hard-coded. In such cases, one must use alternate means to identify the correct meta information.


        This pack supports multiple methods for assigning this information correctly.

        The three metadata fields provided with this pack are index, sourcetype, and source.  These fields are applicable to Splunk delivery, but are not necessarily the correct list when sending to other destinations.    If your deployment requires a different list of fields, be certain to edit the filters in the remaining functions so they correspond with your requirements.

        For some syslog sources, the self-identified host field is actually an
        IP address.  In such cases, the lookup file itself, listing the IP
        address, is the optimal approach.  


        If the lookup above failed to find the host - we can take a second pass at a lookup, using the IP address of the source.


        For optimal performance, do NOT do a reverse DNS lookup if either of these is true:

        a) the data was already found in a lookup,

        b) the host field is not a possible IPv4 address


        Reverse DNS results will always be FQDNs, ensure you account for this within the lookup file.

        If certain metadata fields are missing, attempt to determine them using
        brute-force matching against _raw.  One example is provided, edit and
        clone as needed.


        While this method will work, it does require more processing than the lookup based on other extracted fields.  Use this approach when other approaches are not viable.  To avoid unnecessary overhead, it is recommended to keep the next function in place and enabled.  Add a complete list of necessary metadata fields to the filter.


        Because this type of a match is computationally expensive, the functions in this section are disabled by default.

        Many destinations expect or require, certain meta information to be
        present.  After trying all of the methods above to automatically set the
        meta-information, set any remaining missing information by hard-coding
        it.


        Modify the list of meta fields, and values, as necessary to suit your destination(s).

        Use the identifier of the Stream source to set the "source" metadata
        value, if it was not already set when the Stream source was
        configured.  


        This approach is generally useful, but in specific deployments, it may be preferable to disable this function.  Note that when using the lookup functions (next group), a value in the source column will override any values set in this function.
